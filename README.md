About

This repository is the setup for an application that pulls information from GitHub and creates a snapshot of a developer. 

User Story

AS A scrum/agile manager
WHEN I am looking to form a team
I NEED to find quick informatioon on prospective programmers 

Installation

Node.js, GitHub, Google, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome were used to create the application. I consider myself a junior backend developer, and leaned on other examples/code in order to have a functioning application. 

Credits
